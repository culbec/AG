# Graph Algorithms

This repository contains all my work on the _Graph Algorithms_ course.

## Contents

1. Different [_crossing and distance calculation_](https://github.com/culbec/AG/tree/main/Crossings) algorithms using:

- **Breadth First Search** for finding a **path** between **two nodes** in a _undirected graph_.
- **Depth First Search** for finding a **path** or a **puzzle solving** solution between **two nodes** in a _undirected graph_.
- **Bellman-Ford's algorithm** for finding the **shortest distance** between _a vertex and all other vertices_ in a _directed weighted graph_.
- **Dijkstra's algorithm** for finding the **shortest distance** between _a vertex and all other vertices_ in a _directed positively weighted graph_.
- **Johnson's algorithm** for finding the **shortest distance** between _all vertices_ in a _directed weighted graph_.
